# VsCodeTheme

This is my daily vscode theme written in order to use with dart and flutter.<br>
However it may work fine with other languages.

## Example

Here are some images of the theme.

Some dart code and editor images as example:<br><br>
<img style="height:300px" src="images/code.png"/>
<img style="height:300px" src="images/vscode.png">

## How to install

1. You can download a [VSIX Release](releases/) file and install it through the extensions panel.<br>
Press the options button ("...") and click "Install from VSIX".

2. You can also check the [Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ExBrain.nighty-purple) for this extension
